\title{Evolutionary Behaviour Dynamics Operant Class class}
\description{
In Evolutionary Behaviour Dynamics (McDowell, 2004), the behaviours that an organism is capable of emitting is represented as a set of integers on some domain (e.g. from 0 to 1023). This behavioural domain is divided into subsets to represent different operant classes (from the experimenter's perspective). For example, we may define [0,100] as one operant class and [101,1023] as another operant class. We may then set up an experiment where the EBD algrotihm is reinforced for a response to the first operant class of [0,100] on a variable interval schedule.
}
\details{
The definition of the operant classes (from the organism's perspective) is contained in a \code{EBD_operant_class} object that inherits from the \code{elemental} class.. This object will contain a function that makes integers (genotypes) to operant classes.

The way to put a \code{EBD_operant_class} in your model is as follows:
\enumerate{
    \item Make a list of vectors, each of length 2, containing the boundaries of each class.
    \item Call the \code{make.EBD_operant_class} function.
}
}

\examples{
# Define the operant classes:
class_bounds = list( c(0,40), c(41, 511), c(512, 552), c(553, 1023) )
# Make an "EBD_operant_class" object:
int_to_class = make.EBD_operant_class( class_bounds, "pop_class" )
# Test that it returns the correct class:
plot( matrix( c( 0:1023, int_to_class@EBD_operant_class( 0:1023 ) ), ncol = 2 ) )
abline( v = unlist( class_bounds ) )
